# UFOs
Module 11
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this module is Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time like for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results: 
For using the new webpage, users are able to filter the table

## Summary: 
the new design does not need any button to renew the table, so as soon as we modify the filters; the data are updated.
#### Two recommendations for further development.
1. Having a list for choosing city, country, shape, etc
2. Users need to be able to filter more than 5 filters
